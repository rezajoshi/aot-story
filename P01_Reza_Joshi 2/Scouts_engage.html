                <p>
                    You spin midair, drawing your blades as you fire your hooks back toward the Titan.  
                    Its massive hand swipes at you, but you twist and dodge, the air howls as your gear hums at full power.  
                    This time, you’re not running. You’re fighting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Titan spots you and lets out a deafening roar. You can see the steam rising off its muscles.  
                    Your gas is low, your body aches, and yet… this is what being a Scout is all about.
