        <h1>Reveal Your Identity</h1>
            <p>
                You reveal your identity to the public and the Scout Regiment, gaining recognition for your bravery.  
                Citizens cheer your name, and your actions spark hope inside the walls.
                However, the Military Police are furious. While you are celebrated by some, others now see you as a target for exposing corruption.
                <strong>Ending:</strong> Lose, your name becomes known, and the Military Police executes you for treason.
