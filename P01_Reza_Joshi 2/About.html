        <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                My mission is to create a fun, immersive, and captivating experience for those who are either new or familiar with the Attack on Titan animated series.

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>
                In this interactive adventure, you step into the world of Attack on Titan and make important choices that shape your journey. You can explore different paths, whether joining the Scouts, the Military Police, or the Garrison Regiment, and each decision leads to new challenges and unique endings. Every choice matters, so think carefully as you determine your fate!

        <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Reza and I developed this entire website! I first was introduced to Attack on Titan through my cousin who recommended I watch it. After watching it I quickly understood why it has become a fan-favorite over the years. I made this website as part of a school project and to challenge myself while combining my passion for web development and my personal interests. Through this project, I wanted to create a fun, interactive experience that allows others to explore the world of Attack on Titan in a safe and engaging way. I also learned a lot about designing webpages, organizing content, and making a story come to life. Additionally, I hope to use everything I have learned in future projects!
