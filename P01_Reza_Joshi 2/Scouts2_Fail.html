        <h1>Sorry, Recruit!</h1>
            <p> You gave it everything you had, but the Scout Regiment's training pushes recruits to their limits.  
            Your <strong>ODM gear malfunctioned</strong> during the final exercise, and you couldn't recover in time.  
            The instructors shake their heads as you hit the ground hard.
