        <h1>Mission Failed</h1>
            <p>
                Despite your courage, things didn't go as planned.  
                The battlefield is unforgiving, and one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death.  
                Your story ends here… for now.

            <h2>Fate of a Soldier</h2>
            <p>
                Even the best fall short sometimes. But every loss teaches something,
                and the next recruit who takes your place might just succeed where you couldn't.  
                The fight for humanity continues.
            </p>
