        <h1>Heroes of the Wall</h1>
            <p>
                Without hesitation, you leap from the safety of the wall and charge toward the trapped civilians. Your heart races as you dodge falling debris and use your <strong>ODM gear</strong> to swing through the smoke-filled air.
                You slash through a Titan’s neck in one swift motion, rescuing a mother and her child from certain death. Other soldiers rally behind your bravery, pushing back the Titans and guiding survivors to safety.
                When the dust settles, the breach is sealed, and humanity lives to fight another day. You’ve proven yourself as a true member of the <strong>Garrison Regiment</strong>: loyal, brave, and selfless.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Win Ending:</strong> Your courage saved lives and inspired hope within the walls.
            </p>
