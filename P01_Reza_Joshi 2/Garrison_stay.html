        <h1>Defending the Walls</h1>
            <p>
                You take a deep breath and hold your ground. The streets behind you are filled with panicked civilians, but you refuse to abandon your post. The <strong>Garrison Regiment</strong> was built for moments like this. 
                You and your squad rush to the top of the wall, loading the cannons and firing at the approaching Titans. The air smells of gunpowder and smoke as the first Titan falls, but the battle is far from over.
                Through the chaos, you spot a group of <strong>civilians trapped below</strong>, screaming for help. Debris is falling around them, and a smaller Titan is closing in fast.
                <em>Do you stay and save them, or protect yourself from the collapsing wall?</em>
            </p>
