            <p>You decide to keep what you’ve discovered hidden from your superiors. Instead, you secretly pass the information to trusted members of the <strong>Scout Regiment</strong>.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Your bravery and discretion expose a massive cover-up within the <strong>Military Police</strong> and save countless lives inside the walls. Thanks to your actions, the Scouts are able to capture key officials and deliver the truth to the public.
