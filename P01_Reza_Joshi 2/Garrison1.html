        <!--Garrison Regiment Welcome-->
        <section>
        <h1>Welcome to the Garrison Regiment!</h1>
            <p>
                Congratulations, <strong>recruit</strong>! You have decided to join the <mark>Garrison</mark>, humanity’s first and most reliable line of defense. The Garrison is responsible for <em>guarding the Walls</em>, maintaining cannons, and ensuring the safety of civilians in times of crisis.
                Life in the Garrison may seem peaceful within the walls, but when Titans breach the gates, you are the ones who stand between chaos and survival. Your courage and preparation could mean the difference between life and death for humanity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Tip:</em> The Garrison keeps humanity standing — stay alert, stay brave, and never underestimate the calm before the storm.
            </p>

        <!--Titans Breach the Wall!-->

        <h2>Oh no! Titans Breach the Wall!</h2>
            <p>
                The ground shakes violently as a deafening roar echoes through the air. The <strong>Colossal Titan</strong> has appeared — towering over the gate of <em>Wall Rose</em>. In one mighty kick, the gate explodes into pieces, and chaos erupts in the district below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Flames engulf the houses, soldiers shout orders, and terrified civilians run for their lives. You grip your blades tightly, heart pounding, as smoke fills the sky.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Will you hold your ground or flee for safety?</em>
            </p>
