        <h1>Executed for Treason</h1>
            <p>
                With trembling hands, you deliver the evidence to your commanding officer, hoping to expose the truth and save the integrity of the <strong>Military Police</strong>.
                But instead of praise, you’re met with cold stares. Guards surround you. The room falls silent as you realize your mistake, the very people you tried to report are the ones behind the corruption.
                You are declared a traitor for “spreading false rumors” and sentenced to execution. The truth dies with you, buried deep beneath Wall Sina’s polished surface.
                <strong>Lose Ending:</strong> Silenced by the system you tried to protect.
