            <p>
                You decide to remain anonymous, continuing your covert support for the Scouts.  
                Your identity stays hidden from the Military Police, but your actions save countless lives and protect the walls from corruption.
                The city thrives thanks to your quiet heroism. Though few know your name, the Scout Regiment quietly honors your bravery in their internal reports.
                <strong>Ending:</strong> Win (Anonymous Hero): Your courage changed the future without stepping into the spotlight.
