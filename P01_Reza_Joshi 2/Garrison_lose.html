        <h1>Crushed by the Wall</h1>
            <p>
                Fear grips you as the wall begins to crumble. You take a step back, choosing to protect yourself rather than risk everything for the civilians below.
                But before you can react, a massive section of debris collapses from above. The world flashes white, then goes silent. The last thing you hear is the desperate cry of someone you could have saved.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lose Ending:</strong> You survived the Titans... but not your own fear.
            </p>
