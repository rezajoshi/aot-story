        <h1>Decision Made: You Leave the Scouts</h1>
            <p>
                You choose not to try again. The training grounds fall silent behind you as you walk away,
                the Scout insignia out of reach for now. It’s a quiet, painful choice, but also a clear one. You hand over your gear and leave the compound,
                unsure what the future holds.
            </p>
