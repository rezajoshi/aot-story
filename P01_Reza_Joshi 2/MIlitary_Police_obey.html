        <h1>A Safe but Quiet Life</h1>
            <p> 
                You follow every command without question, rising steadily through the ranks of the  
                <strong>Military Police Regiment</strong>. Your uniform stays spotless, your reports perfect,  
                and your life peaceful within the marble walls of the interior.
            </p>

                The days blur together, morning patrols, routine inspections, polite nods from nobles.  
                While others fight and fall beyond the gates, you enjoy quiet meals and dreamless sleep.  
                The world outside fades into nothing more than a distant story.

            <p>
                You’ve survived.  
                Yet, deep down, you wonder, was safety worth the silence?
            </p>
