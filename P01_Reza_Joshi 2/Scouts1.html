            <h2>Scout Regiment: Training Test</h2>
                <p>The morning sun shines over the <mark>Scout Regiment training field</mark>. 
                Recruits gather, nervous but excited. 
                Today is the day you prove whether you have what it takes to join humanity's bravest soldiers.
                </p>

                <p>Your instructor, <strong>Commander Hange Zoe</strong>, shouts, 
                “Listen up, recruits! Today's ODM gear test will separate the strong from the weak. 
                Stay calm, balance your weight, and remember, <em>momentum is everything!</em>”
                </p>

            <p>
                You attach your Omni-Directional Mobility (ODM) gear cables to the wooden poles and take a deep breath. 
                The ground feels steady under your boots, but your hands are trembling. 
                Around you, other recruits are already swinging through the air. 
                <strong>This is your moment.</strong> Will you pass, or will your nerves get the best of you?
